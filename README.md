Animations made with the Underworld2 Python API

This is a GitHub repository containing relevant files that I have used to develop models in Paraview with Professor William Holt. The repository also contains ``.avi`` files of all the animations I have made for those models.

Note: The ``.py`` files cannot be run by themselves. Relevant packages such as ``numpy`` and ``UWGeodynamics`` must be installed.
